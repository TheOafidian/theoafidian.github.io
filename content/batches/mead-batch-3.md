# Fika

If you've ever met a Swede, you've heard about fika. Fika is all about having yourself a dark roast, some sweets and good company and take the time to have a chat. 
The only thing that could still be missing in this utopian concoction would be... Mead?

Therefore Mel and fika, a pun on the word malefica which is an old timey way of saying witch.

## Ingredients

As a first experiment a small batch of 5L is made, the honey during primary is a cheap store honey. 
While the honey used for backsweetening is an artisanal mountain honey.
