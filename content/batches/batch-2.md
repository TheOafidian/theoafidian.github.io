# Czech Pilsner: Concoctions

## Ingredients

- Brewing water: the water from the faucet is too hard for this type of beer. Therefor the ion contents are dilluted by mixing it with distilled water.
- 2 kg's of [Bohemian pilsner malt](https://brouwland.com/nl/mout/2043-bohemian-pilsner-mout-weyermann-3-5-ebc-5-kg.html)
- [Saaz Hop pellets](https://brouwland.com/nl/hop/19623-hopkorrels-saaz-100-g-de.html).

## Brewing

### Decoction

Decoction is a process where part of the mash is separated from the larger part and boiled. 
This process was traditionally repeated 3-4 or more times and helped to get the most out of the malt. 
Due to the quality of modern malt, this process is no longer frequently used (by some even considered a waste of time and energy). 
To brew a Czech pils however, it would be a shame to forego this process.

Therefore in this recipe a single decoction was performed, to honour the tradition and hopefully enrich the flavour of the malt. 

### Brew schedule

### Hop schedule

- Specific gravity: 

## Primary Fermentation

A fastbrew fermenter is used for this batch. Both primary and secondary fermentation should be able to be done in the same reservoir.

- sanitization recipient, airlock and tools used
<!-- (- *SafCider* yeast activated prior to adding to the pressed apple juice) -->
- yeast pitched and waterlock placed

## Bottling

- Specifig gravity:

- sanitization pump and bottles
- priming sugar added (30g brown sugar) for carbonization
- bottles filled by faucet from fastbrew, with minimal headspace
- bottles were left for at least a week before carbonization was adequate
