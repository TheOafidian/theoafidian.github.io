# Backyard Grapes Sour Wine

## Ingredients

- About 3 baskets of backyard picked grapes from a friend, boiled and filtered. 

## Preparation of the juice

- Whole grapes were boiled for about 40 mins
- juice from a lemon and 2 bags of rooibos tea were added
- Juice was filtered trough strainer and cooled to RT
- sanitization recipient, airlock and tools used
- 5L Juice transfered to glass damme Jeanne.
- Pectinase was added for 8hs

## One Stop Fermentation

- half a tablespoon of yeast nutrients added
- *SafCider* yeast pitched and waterlock placed

There was some overflow in the airlock the first few days due to intense fermentation of the sugar->CO2 by the yeast.
After 3.5 weeks fermentation stalled (still at secondary fermentation likely) and the wine was bottled.

## Bottling

- sanitization pump and bottles
- bottles filled by pump, with minimal headspace

A clear red wine was obtained (if the active yeast sediments to the bottom of the bottle). 

## Taste
Dry, very sour taste with a very lambic-like profile. 
Not a winner for everyone, but the owner of the grapes is a sour-lover! 

## Recommendations future

- Experiment with more flavours; adding wood chips? 
- Experiment with walnuts (! needs to condition half a year, so be patient...)
