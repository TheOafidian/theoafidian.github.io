# Backyard Apple Cider

## Ingredients

- 2,5 baskets of apples from our yard, used fresh from the tree. 

## Pressing

- Total of 5L pressed
- Specific gravity: 1.050 -> estimated 6.5% EtOH after fermentation
- Add 500 mg of pectinase to break down pectines
- 500 mg Campden added for 24h in cooking pot with rag to allow evaporation

## One Stop Fermentation

After treatment with campden:

- sanitization recipient, airlock and tools used
- half a tablespoon of yeast nutrients added
- *SafCider* yeast pitched and waterlock placed

After 2-3 days, an intense Rhino fart smell ðŸ‘ƒðŸ’©ðŸ˜° filled the air while CO2 production could be seen. 
Likely due to a shortage in N-building blocks for the yeast. 
Raisins could be added but those were not available at the time. 

After 4 weeks fermentation, a cold crash was performed by placing the glass jar in the fridge for 24 hours.

## Bottling

- sanitization pump and bottles
- priming sugar added (38g brown sugar) for carbonization
- bottles filled by pump, with minimal headspace
- bottles were left for at least a week before carbonization was adequate

<!--## Taste

Crisp, acidic taste with soft carbonization at one week and more usual carbonization after two. 
Clear cider with a very small layer of sedimented yeast. Taste seems to age well on bottle. Hop taste is very subtle.

## Recommendations future

- Add extra N-source, eg: raisins
- Experiment with more flavours
- Experiment with other yeast
