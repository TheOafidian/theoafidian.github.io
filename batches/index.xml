Fika is all about having yourself a dark roast, some sweets and good company and take the time to have a chat. The only thing that could still be missing in this utopian concoction would be&amp;hellip; Mead?
Therefore Mel and fika, a pun on the word malefica which is an old timey way of saying witch.

Traditionally sorghum flour is mixed with ripened bananas (Matoke/Musa acuminata) and fermented to an orange, sweet, lightly hazy drink. Different countries have their own spin on the beer and their own names for the brew; mubisi (Uganda), urwaga (Kenya) and kasiksi (DR Congo) to name a few. In Tanzania their banana beer called mbege is even brewed commercially.</description></item><item><title>Beer Batch #4: een pintje d'Abbey</title><link>https://theoafidian.github.io/batches/batch-4/</link><pubDate>Sat, 03 Feb 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://theoafidian.github.io/batches/batch-4/</guid><description>Experimenting with oak A simple abbey beer, augmented with vanilla infused oak chips.

It is a highly sugary substance that completes fermentation in under two days. It has an opaque, milky color and a viscous texture. The drink turns more slimy as it reaches the end of its shelf life, which is not long as it spoils quite soon. Pulque fermentations contain a large nuber of wild bacteria and yeast, which are the cause of the remarkable speed at which it ferments and spoils.</description></item><item><title>Cider Batch #2: Backyard Apples</title><link>https://theoafidian.github.io/batches/cider-batch-2/</link><pubDate>Wed, 04 Oct 2023 20:13:20 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://theoafidian.github.io/batches/cider-batch-2/</guid><description>Backyard Apple Cider Ingredients 2,5 baskets of apples from our yard, used fresh from the tree.
