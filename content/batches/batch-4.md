## Experimenting with oak

A simple abbey beer, augmented with vanilla infused oak chips. A batch of 5L was made with:

{{% card recipe="Pintje d'Abbey" %}}
- 1kg [Bohemian pilsner malt](https://brouwland.com/nl/mout/2043-bohemian-pilsner-mout-weyermann-3-5-ebc-5-kg.html) or any other pils malt, but I still had this around
- 300g [Abbey malt](https://brouwland.com/en/malts/2063-abbey-malt-weyermann-40-50-ebc-1-kg.html)
- 40g of Saaz hop (definetly try other hops, but again I still had this lying around) 
- a teaspoon of Irish Moss
- a packet of [M47 abbey yeast](https://brouwland.com/en/yeast-and-bacteria/1945-dried-brewing-yeast-belgian-abbey-m47-mangrove-jack-s-craft-series-10-g.html)
- about 8g of Oak chips

## Hopping schedule

The following hopping schedule is used:

The water was brought to a boil before hopping.
- 20g of hop was added at the start
- 20 g of hop was added after 30 min
- the Irish Moss was added  for the last 5 min

with a total cooking time of an hour.

## Cooling

The brew was cooled to around 20Â°C, by submersing a cooler in the cooking pot and letting cold water run trough it for about 15 minutes.

### Gravity measurement

- Specific gravity measured: 1.045
- Alcohol percentage expected: 4.6% 

This alcohol percentage is quite low for an abbey beer... (they're usually around 7%). Means we can drink more though :D

## Primary Fermentation

A fastbrew fermenter is used for this batch  and secondaryduring primary fermentation.
Most of the sediment was already removed during the primary by collecting it by gravity.

## Secondary fermentation

After about 2 weeks, the brew was transfered to a glass demijohn. The oak pellet was added to the brew and the fermentation was left for two more weeks prior to bottling. 

## Bottling

- priming sugar added in the bottles for carbonization (sugarcubes)
- bottles filled with laminar flow of pump, with minimal headspace
- bottles were left for at least 2 weeks before tasting (I'm not a patient man)

## Taste and looks
- Rich flavour, hint of vanilla, very pleasant 
- Nice color, feel, alcohol percentage could be a bit higher.
- Foam could be better, but plenty of CO2

## Recommendations future

- Take more notes
- Experiment with other hops
- Make more of this
