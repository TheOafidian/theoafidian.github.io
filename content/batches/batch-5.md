# Banana beer

People have been using bananas to ferment alcoholic beverages for the ages throughout Africa. Traditionally sorghum flour is mixed with ripened bananas (Matoke/*Musa acuminata*) and fermented to an orange, sweet, lightly hazy drink. Different countries have their own spin on the beer and their own names for the brew; mubisi (Uganda), urwaga (Kenya) and kasiksi (DR Congo) to name a few. In Tanzania their banana beer called mbege is even brewed commercially.

For this recipe I'd like to go a little bananas, but use instead the plantain (*Musa paradisiaca*), which is also an ingredient used in the warm beverage called chapo, made by the indigenous Shipibo from the Peruvian amazon.

To mix and match a little we're simply starting off with a traditionally British mild, to which we will introduce the plantain in secondary to further accompany the chocolate and fruity flavour.


## Ingredients

As this is a pilot (I might try out some more banana ideas) and I want to get to know my new brewing kettle, this recipe will be for 5L.

- [1.5 kg mild-ale malt](https://brouwland.com/en/malts/20652-pauls-malt-keep-flying-maris-otter-5-7-ebc-5-kg.html)
- [250g dark cristal malt](https://brouwland.com/en/malts/20657-pauls-malt-deep-river-dark-crystal-200-250-ebc-5-kg.html)
- 50g chocolate malt
- [Northern brewer](https://brouwland.com/en/hops/2201-hop-pellets-northern-brewer-100-g.html)
- [Goldings](https://brouwland.com/en/hops/13267-hops-goldings-100-g.html)
- 500g of plantain
- [London Ale yeast](https://brouwland.com/en/yeast-and-bacteria/20821-fermentis-dried-brewing-yeast-safale-w-68-115-g.html)

## Hopping schedule

The following hopping schedule is used:

The water was brought to a boil before hopping.
- 3.3g of Northern brewer was added at the start
- 1 teaspoon of Irish Moss was added the last 15 min
- 1.6 g of Goldings was added at the last 5 min

with a total cooking time of an hour 10 min.

## Cooling

The brew was cooled to around 20Â°C, by submersing a cooler in the kettle and letting cold water run trough it for about 15 minutes.


### Gravity measurement

- Specific gravity measured: 1.065
- Alcohol percentage expected: 7.22% 

## Primary Fermentation

Primary fermentation is done in a glass carboy. The brew started bubbling heavily in the morning. 

## Secondary fermentation 
Plantain is mixed and cooked prior to adding it to the brew. 
<!--
## Bottling

- Specifig gravity measured: 5% alcohol indeed
- sanitization pump and bottles
- priming sugar added (30g brown sugar) for carbonization
- bottles filled by faucet from fastbrew, with minimal headspace
- bottles were left for at least a week before carbonization was adequate

## Taste
- Too bitter for a pilsner
- Otherwise, nice color, feel and alcohol percentage.

## Recommendations future

- Use hop bag, and be a little less generous with the hop.
- Use a cooler, cooling takes way too long.
