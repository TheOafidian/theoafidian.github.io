# Honey Mead: Bees and Beers

## Ingredients

We're aiming for a first, simple batch of 5 litres, using local bee honey. 
- 7L of Brewing water: the water from the faucet is quite hard, therefore the ion contents are dilluted by mixing it with distilled water in a 2/1 ratio.
- around 1.25 kg's local honey
- [Applejack's Mead Yeast](https://brouwland.com/nl/gisten-en-bacterieen/1948-gedroogde-gist-mead-mangrove-jack-s-craft-series-10-g.html?#ins_sr=eyJwcm9kdWN0SWQiOiIwNTAuNzE3LjgifQ==)
- Spoonful of citric acid or juice from two lemons
- Half a cup of strong tea

## Brewing

Mix honey and water and bring to a boil. Make sure the total volume at the end is still 5L. 
(Optional filtering of the brew.)
Add citric acid and tea while the brew is still hot.

### Cooling

The brew was cooled to around 25Â°C, using a cooler.

<!--### Gravity measurement

- Specific gravity measured: 
- Alcohol percentage expected:

## Primary and Secondary Fermentation

Both fermentations are done in a carboy in the dark at RT. No off-tastes due to autolysis of the yeast are expected unless we leave the brew for longer than a month, but I sure don't have that patience ðŸ˜‰. For the first few days, the top is just covered with a cloth as a lot of CO2 production is expected.
After that a water lock is placed on the brew after possibly topping the carboy off with more sterilized water.

- sanitization carboy, airlock and tools used
- yeast pitched and cloth covered the opening

<!--
## Bottling

- Specifig gravity measured:

- sanitization pump and bottles
- priming sugar added (30g brown sugar) for carbonization
- bottles filled by faucet from fastbrew, with minimal headspace
- bottles were left for at least a week before carbonization was adequate

 ## Taste


## Recommendations future

- Use bags for the hops to prevent sludge formation.
- Create larger amount of brew, taking evaporation into account.
- Find alternative way to cool down brew.
