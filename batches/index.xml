It is a highly sugary substance that completes fermentation in under two days. It has an opaque, milky color and a viscous texture. The drink turns more slimy as it reaches the end of its shelf life, which is not long as it spoils quite soon. Pulque fermentations contain a large nuber of wild bacteria and yeast, which are the cause of the remarkable speed at which it ferments and spoils.</description></item><item><title>Cider Batch #2: Backyard Apples</title><link>https://theoafidian.github.io/batches/cider-batch-2/</link><pubDate>Wed, 04 Oct 2023 20:13:20 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://theoafidian.github.io/batches/cider-batch-2/</guid><description>Backyard Apple Cider Ingredients 2,5 baskets of apples from our yard, used fresh from the tree.
