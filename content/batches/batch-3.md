# Return of the Czech

[The previous recipe](https://theoafidian.github.io/batches/batch-2/) was followed for a batch of 10L, but the hopping schedule was adapted.

## New Hopping schedule

The following hopping schedule is used:

The water was brought to a boil before hopping.
- 17g of hop was added at the start
- 7 g of hop was added after 30 min
- another 7 g was added after 45 min

with a total cooking time of an hour.

## Cooling

The brew was cooled to around 20Â°C, by submersing a cooler in the cooking pot and letting cold water run trough it for about 15 minutes.

<!--
### Gravity measurement

- Specific gravity measured: 1.048
- Alcohol percentage expected: 5% 

This alcohol is still relatively high for a Czech pils (they're usually around 4.4%), but I sure won't complain!

## Primary Fermentation

A fastbrew fermenter is used for this batch. Both primary and secondary fermentation should be able to be done in the same reservoir.

- sanitization fastbrewer, airlock and tools used
- yeast pitched and waterlock placed

## Bottling

- Specifig gravity measured: 5% alcohol indeed
- sanitization pump and bottles
- priming sugar added (30g brown sugar) for carbonization
- bottles filled by faucet from fastbrew, with minimal headspace
- bottles were left for at least a week before carbonization was adequate

## Taste
- Too bitter for a pilsner
- Otherwise, nice color, feel and alcohol percentage.

## Recommendations future

- Use hop bag, and be a little less generous with the hop.
- Use a cooler, cooling takes way too long.
