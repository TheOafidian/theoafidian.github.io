# Agave Mead: "Pulque Fiction"

Pulque is a traditional alcoholic beverage was made from fermenting the aguamiel (loosely translated to mead)from agaves in ancient Mexico. It is a highly sugary substance that completes fermentation in under two days.
It has an opaque, milky color and a viscous texture. The drink turns more slimy as it reaches the end of its shelf life, which is not long as it spoils quite soon. Pulque fermentations contain a large nuber of wild bacteria and yeast, which are the cause of the remarkable speed at which it ferments and spoils. 
In 2020 the process of the Pulque fermentation was [investigated by profiling the microbial communities along the process](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0944501320304614?via%3Dihub). Among the abundant bacteria identified were typical bacteria found in fermented foods (favourable genera like *Lactobacillus, Leuconostoc* and less desirable species from genera such as *Enterobacter*). Among the wild yeast *Saccharomyces cerevisiae* was found as expected from earlier work, alongside a plethora of other wild yeasts.

Pulque has a rich history, and was marginalized in modern years by Western beer exporters for their own benefit. Luckily the beverage is now gaining in popularity in Mexico, as a hip and trendy fermented drink.

As a tribute to the old pulque, I will try my hand at a mead made from agave syrup. Though it will not be anywere close to an actual pulque; hence the name 'Pulque Fiction".

## Ingredients

As a first experiment a small batch of 5L is made, using store bought agave syrup. 
- 5L of Brewing water.
- around 800 mL of agave syrup
- [Applejack's Mead Yeast](https://brouwland.com/nl/gisten-en-bacterieen/1948-gedroogde-gist-mead-mangrove-jack-s-craft-series-10-g.html?#ins_sr=eyJwcm9kdWN0SWQiOiIwNTAuNzE3LjgifQ==)
- Juice from two lemon and two spoonfulls of lemon zest <!-- alternatively a spoonful of citric acid -->
- Juice from 4 oranges
- Yeast supplement

## Brewing

Mix syrup and water and bring to a boil. Make sure the total volume at the end is still 5L. 
Add lemons and tea while the brew is still hot.

### Cooling

The brew was cooled to around 25Â°C, using a cooler.

<!--### Gravity measurement

- Specific gravity measured: 
- Alcohol percentage expected: 
--> 
## Primary and Secondary Fermentation


Both fermentations are done in a carboy in the dark at RT. For the first few days, the top is just covered with a cloth as a lot of CO2 production is expected.
After that a water lock is placed on the brew.

- sanitization carboy, airlock and tools used
- yeast pitched and airlock placed

<!--
## Bottling

- Specifig gravity measured:

- sanitization pump and bottles
- priming sugar added (30g brown sugar) for carbonization
- bottles filled by faucet from fastbrew, with minimal headspace
- bottles were left for at least a week before carbonization was adequate

 ## Taste


## Recommendations future

- Use bags for the hops to prevent sludge formation.
- Create larger amount of brew, taking evaporation into account.
- Find alternative way to cool down brew.
