# Backyard Apples & Hop Bells Cider

## Ingredients

- Backyard picked hop from a friend, dried and stored before use.
- 2,5 baskets of apples from our yard, stored in the fridge.

## Pressing

- Total of 5L pressed
- Specific gravity: 1.050 -> estimated 6.5% EtOH after fermentation
- 500 mg Campden added for 24h in cooking pot with rag to allow evaporation

## Primary Fermentation

Originally the plan was to do primary fermentation in a fermenting bucket and have a second fermentation in a Damme-Jeane.
Unfortunately the fermenting bucket leaked too much and it was opted to do both fermentations in the Damme-Jean. The pressed apple juice was transfered to the recipient.

- sanitization recipient, airlock and tools used
- half a tablespoon of yeast nutrients added
- *SafCider* yeast activated prior to adding to the pressed apple juice
- 15g hop bells added
- yeast pitched and waterlock placed

There was some overflow in the airlock the first few days due to intense fermentation of the sugar->CO2 by the yeast.
After 3,5 weeks fermentation seemed looked stalled (still at secondary fermentation likely) and a cold crash was performed by placing the glass jar in the fridge for 24 hours.

## Bottling

- sanitization pump and bottles
- priming sugar added (30g brown sugar) for carbonization
- bottles filled by pump, with minimal headspace
- bottles were left for at least a week before carbonization was adequate

Second specific gravity measurement was only thought of after adding priming sugar, so no measurement to report here.


## Taste

Crisp, acidic taste with soft carbonization at one week and more usual carbonization after two. 
Clear cider with a very small layer of sedimented yeast. Taste seems to age well on bottle. Hop taste is very subtle.

## Recommendations future

- Experiment with more flavours, still a bit "too vanilla"
- Allow longer second fermentation, be patient
